Revisor

The goal of Revisor is to create a very fast process supervision system.
The system should be fast both in terms of detecting process death and restart and in accepting user commands for process control.

Having Revisor monitoring a process that stalls / dies repeatably, should not affect the running and monitoring of other monitored processes.
